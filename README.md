# What is this?

This is an open source project to help people develop own skills, build and execute personal development plans, grow professionally and build own career.

While working in diferent big companies as an Engineering Manager, I haven't seen much systems suitable for this. Although idea is very simple. So decided to develop own one.

Enjoy! Get better every day!
